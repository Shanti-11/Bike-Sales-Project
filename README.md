 Bike Sales Analysis Project (Excel)

 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Bike Sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The aim was to clean raw data, explore sales patterns, and provide business insights through visual dashboards and pivot table analysis.

 Data Cleaning
The original dataset contained various inconsistencies and required preprocessing. Key cleaning steps included:

-Removed duplicate records

-Handled missing or blank values

-Standardized date and categorical fields

-Corrected formatting issues (e.g., numeric vs. text)

-Created new calculated columns (Age Bracket)


 Pivot Table Analysis
Multiple pivot tables were created to explore different business questions, such as:

-Avg Income Per Purchase

-Customer  Commute

-Customer Age Brackets
Each pivot table provided a clear breakdown of how different segments performed.


 Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard was created to summarize the analysis. Key components include:

Filter slicers for Region, Education, and Marital Status

Charts for:

-Monthly sales trends

-Regional performance comparison

-Gender-based product preference
The dashboard allows users to quickly gain insights and drill down into specific segments.
